    "Deep convolutional neuronal network (CNN) was originally invented in 1990s, but popularized these years by the [success](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-w) in [ImageNet challenge](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/). Training a model for ImageNet will take several days with powerful GPUs. So here we will do a similar but much simpler task. In this task you will use a specific network structure called [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf) to do digit classification. It is originally designed by Yann Lecun, a pioneer for using CNN. The network will be trained on [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)"

    "This task consists:\n",
    "1. Train a deep convolutional neuron network on MNIST dataset with a deep learning framework you choose.\n",
    "2. Use trained model to do digit classification. In your report, include some digit images and their classification result. Show some misclassified digits.\n",
    "3. Include the network structure used for training in the report. Plot the train/test error over iteration.\n",
    "4. In the full MNIST dataset, there are around 6000 training images for each digit. Now you need to use a subset for training. Change the number of training images for each digit to 1, 10, 100, 1000 and all images. Use the same test set and plot the train/test error over number of training images."

Please read the requirement of programming language and operation system before you begin. If you are comfortable with MATLAB, the **matconvnet** should be the easist option for this task.\n",
