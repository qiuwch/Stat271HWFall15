    "Welcome to the 3rd part of HW2. In this part, you are encouraged to explore the sparse coding with MATLAB code. The original code can be downloaded from http://redwood.berkeley.edu/bruno/sparsenet/. Please refer to the paper (http://redwood.berkeley.edu/bruno/papers/nature-paper.pdf) for more theoretic details. Please note that a few modifications are needed in this homework. \n",

    "The code provided by the author uses compiled c code for performance consideration. So you need to compile the code with mex command before using it. The README of downloaded code contains a brief guide about how to do that. The mex (c code) part was written and tested in a unix-like system. In the experiment, we found the code can be run normally in Mac and Linux,  but not stable in Windows. So, you are allowed to complete this part in a teamwork (no more than 3 students in one group).\n",

    "    In this subpart, we calculate the sparse coefficient of natural images. Please change the M with other parameters set as the default and see what the basis (shown in Fig 1) look like. Please select M from these numbers: 25, 64, 100.\n",

    "\n",
    "    In the 2nd subpart, we change the matrix X reconstructed by the basis from natural images to the high-dimensional sinusoid images, which is different from the 1st subpart. First, the \"gensin.m\" can help you generate the sinusoid patches. In \"gensin.m\", you need to set the \"omega\" parameter to choose certain frequency of sinusoid patches. Second, in each iteration reassign X with randomly patches selected from the high-frequency sinusoids pool generated by the \"gensin.m\" script. A few modifications are required to reassign X compared with the original code. Then change the M with other parameters set as the default. Typical, you need to set M as: 4, 36, 100, 900. How do these basis change according to the different M (the number of basis)? **Warning, $ M=900 $ requires hours of computation.**\n",

    "    Congrats to move to the last subpart. In this subpart, we need to generate the low-frequency of sinusoid images, which is the only difference from the 2nd subpart. Same with before, change the M with other parameters set as the default. We suggest you set the M as: 4, 36, 100. How do these basis change according to the different M? Please make comparisons with the 2nd part and explain why the difference come out. You are encouraged to use the \"ShowPatches.m\" code to visualize the sinusoid patches you generated in the subpart 2 and 3. \n",
